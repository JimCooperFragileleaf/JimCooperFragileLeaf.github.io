            During September and October of 2016, a group of Sustainable Development master’s 
            students at Utrecht University embarked on a project examining food waste at the 
            University. Specifically, they were interested in the amount wasted at events and 
            meetings organised at the University and what solutions could be put into place 
            to reduce this.  Their results showed that over a two-week period the amount of 
            food and beverages which were thrown way after such occasions generated 
            613 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> and used 6843015 litres of water. To put this into context 
            it was the same as driving was 3841 km in an average car and having 85538 baths.
            To maintain awareness of the issue, this website was created. Its aim is simple, 
            to make you think about the impact your lunch has.
