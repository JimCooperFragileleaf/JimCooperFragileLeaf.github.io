            During September and October of 2016, a group of Sustainable Development masterâ€™s 
            students at Utrecht University embarked on a project examining food waste at the 
            University. Specifically, they were interested in the amount wasted at events and 
            meetings organised at the University and what solutions could be put into place 
            to reduce this.  Their results showed that over a two-week period the amount of 
            food and beverages which were thrown way after such occasions was the equivalent 
            of n kg of Co2 and n litres of water. To put this into context it was the same as 
            driving was n km in an average car and having n baths.  To maintain awareness of 
            the issue, this website was created. Its aim is simple, to make you think about 
            the impact your lunch has.
